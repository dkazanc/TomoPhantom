**TomoPhantom <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2018.05.003">[1]</a> is a toolbox written in C language to generate customisable 2D-4D phantoms (with a temporal capability) and their analytical projection data for various image processing (e.g. reconstruction, denoising, deblurring, segmentation, etc.) and machine learning tasks (e.g. deep learning, classification, clustering, etc.).**

        <h3 class="post-title">About TomoPhantom </h3>
        <p> TomoPhantom is recommended for various image processing tasks that require extensive numerical testing: image reconstruction, denoising, deblurring, etc. Specifically, TomoPhantom is best-suited for testing various tomographic image reconstruction (TIR) methods. For TIR algorithms testing, the popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepp%E2%80%93Logan_phantom">Shepp-Logan phantom</a> is not always a good choice due to its piecewise-constant nature. This toolbox provides a simple modular approach to efficiently build customisable 2D-4D phantoms consisting of piecewise-constant, piecewise-smooth, and smooth analytical objects.

Using <a href="https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoRec">TomoRec</a>, <a href="http://www.astra-toolbox.com/">ASTRA-toolbox</a> or <a href="http://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en">TomoPy</a> packages.  

### **TomoPhantom** prerequisites: 

 * Python (tested ver. 2.7/3.5); Cython OR
 * [MATLAB](www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) 
 * C compilers: GCC/MinGW/[TDM-GCC](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/)/Visual Studio
 * [CMake](https://cmake.org) (if this installation route is chosen)

### Other dependencies (required for reconstruction mainly):
 * [TomoRec](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoRec)
 * [ASTRA-toolbox](http://www.astra-toolbox.com/)
 * [TomoPy](http://tomopy.readthedocs.io)

## Installation:

The package comes as a [CMake](https://cmake.org) project so you will need CMake (v.>=3) to configure it. Additionally you will need a C compiler, and a build tool as `make` (on linux). The toolkit may be used with Python and/or Matlab for which we provide wrappers. TomoPhantom's core is built as shared library and it should be possible to call it directly from C/C++, but currently no C/C++ API is available. 

Prerequisites:
1. [CMake](https://cmake.org) >= 3.0
2. a C compiler with OpenMP
3. [libm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_mathematical_functions#libm) on linux
4. [Cython](https://cython.org/) to build the Python wrappers (optional)
5. MATLAB installation to build MATLAB wrappers (optional)

### Build

1. Clone this repository to a directory, i.e. `TomoPhantom`, 
2. create a build directory. 
3. Issue `cmake` to configure (or `cmake-gui`, or `ccmake`, or `cmake3`). Use additional flags to fine tune the configuration. 

### CMake flags
Flags used during configuration

| CMake flag | type | meaning |
|:---|:----|:----|
| `BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER` | bool | `ON\|OFF` whether to build the Python wrapper |
| `BUILD_MATLAB_WRAPPER` | bool | `ON\|OFF` whether to build the Matlab wrapper |
| `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` | path | your favourite install directory |
| `PYTHON_DEST_DIR` | path | python modules install directory (default `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/python`) |
| `MATLAB_DEST_DIR` | path | Matlab modules install directory (default `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/matlab`)|
| `CONDA_BUILD`| bool | `ON\|OFF` whether it is installed with `setup.py install`|
| `Matlab_ROOT_DIR` | path | Matlab directory|
|`PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` | path | /path/to/python/executable|

Here an example of build on Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../ -DCONDA_BUILD=OFF -DMatlab_ROOT_DIR=/home/algol/matlab2016/ -DBUILD_MATLAB_WRAPPER=ON \
  -DBUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./install
make install
# let Python find the shared library
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:./install
# let MATLAB find the shared library and mex files
PATH="./install/matlab:$PATH" LD_LIBRARY_PATH="./install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" matlab
```

See [`run.sh`](https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom/blob/master/run.sh) script for additional examples on build.

## Installation:

### Python (conda-build)
```
git clone https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom.git
cd TomoPhantom
conda build Wrappers/Python/conda-recipe --numpy 1.12 --python 3.5
conda install tomophantom --use-local --force
```

### Package library modules:
- **Phantom2DLibrary.dat** and **Phantom3DLibrary.dat** are editable text files with parametrised models (2D/3D versions of Shepp-Logan, Defrise, and QRM phantoms are included). The generation of new phantoms is highly encouraged, please submit them through pull requests or via e-mail bellow.
