Where to start?
***************

Once TomoPhantom is installed, see :ref:`ref_installation`, one can look into how to :ref:`howto_buildphantoms`. It is also recommended to have a quick read 
of :ref:`ref_glossary`, to be in-sync with the terminology used in Documentation. 

If one needs a quick try and hands-on experience, please go straight to :ref:`tutorials_content` and follow them in the presented order. 
It is also useful to clone the `Github repository <https://github.com/dkazanc/TomoPhantom/tree/master/tomophantom/>`_ and go over Demos, however, some Demos might be obsolete.
In future, we would like to move things from Demos to Jupyter notebooks that are part of Tutorials at the moment. 

Thanks for using TomoPhantom!
